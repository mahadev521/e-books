			If some one starts telling shiva purana katha they must face to north and the listener have to face to east..!
the devoteee who was intrested to listen about shiva maha gadha must have to sleep on floor, must have pure diet, should eat dinner only after listening to katha.
and he must over come lust,anger,greed,condemning others.!

	sages were performing yagas at prayag kshetra. sutaji came to them.
they asked sutaji "please tell a solution for salvation in this kali yuga" all caste people were not performing their duties.
then how can one attain salvation?
    
	sutaji narrated a story to sages:
			" during initial period of "svet varah kalp" 6 prominent sages were gathered at triveni sanghamam and want to know who is supreme diety. they went to bramha dev to know the answer.
brahma dev replied the bramha vishnu and rudhra were incrination of mahadev. mahadev is the supreme. 
+++++knowing about mahadev listening to his qualities and singing songs in thought of him and praise him are greatest means to get unite with him ++++++(shravan)
purification of mind and heart by chanting name of mahadev(Manan)
singing devotional songs on mahadev, worshipping him in ones own language in form oh hymes, vedas, stothras(kirtan).
			these 3 were done to get liberation/moksha


		SHIVA LINGA
	if a person is incapable of doing shravan, manan , kirtan then he should worship shiva linga to get liberation.
linga is form of shiva. NIRGUNA without any qualities.





		panchakritiya..! ( five duties preached to vishnuji and brahmaji by lord shiva)
{
		shristi    given to brahma ji
		sthithi    given to vishnu ji
		samhar     alloted to rudhra avatar of mahadev
		tribhov (act of hiding something, preventing it from being known) alloted to mahesh avatar of mahadev
		anurag (kindness/moksha)    kept by himself mahadev..!
}

		OMKAR
it consist of the power of shiva and shakthi. later lord shiva initiated it to brahma ji and vishnu ji
Is the divine mathra to attain salvation and get worldy accomplishments.


		HOW TO WORSHIP SHIVA LINGA
{
  one should make linga with mud or rock or metal and establish it in a place where one can worship it daily without any hindrance.
	MEASUREMENTS:-linga should be made along with pedestal.breadth of thickness of linga should be 12 times of thickness of the ones finger(may be thumd) and height must be 20 times of fingers height.
		
"THE MOBILE LINGA SHOULD BE IN SMALL IN SIZE AND FIXED".
after making the linga it should be worshipped after performing shodasopachar.
thumb also resembles linga so it can also be worshipped. while worshipping shiva linga the mantra
"OM NAMA SHIVAYA" must be chanted continuosly. chanting this mantra 5 crore times helps a person attaining abode of shiva.
worship of shiva during midnight is considered to be especially fructifying(soo good).

		sacred piligrimages of shiva
{
	there are number of piligrimages of shiva in banks of river yamuna and indus. havind residing at the bank of river saraswathi helps a person to attain abode of brahma.
worshipping shiva in the temples at the river banks of rivers like ganga , indus ,kaveri , thungabadra, godavari, narmada, saraswathi, etc
and bestows(like ashes leaving/ any virtues to ancestors ) libertes the man from all of his sins.

}


		there is no fixation in caste.
         the dwija is called rebirth of a man. he was born physically and was again born spiritually (looks same like baptism in christianity)
         dwija brahmin :- who only do rituals and study vedas
         kshatriya brahmin :- not prominent in vedas
         vyshya brahmin :- who engages in agriculture and business.
         shudra brahmin :- who engages in condemning others and critisizing others.
     		ALSO IN KSHATRIYA IT FOLLOWS..!
         king : looks after welfare of his subjects
	 remaining soilders who will fight for or defense kingdom are called kshatriyas simply.
         vaishya kshatriya : who indulges in business 
	 sudhra kshatriya : who engages himself service of the three superior castes..! ( i thinks this is the rare case when a king of one kingdom-A had won on another kingdom-B then the soilders will be slaves of this kingdom-B then they will be called as shudras..!)
